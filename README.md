# famous-coders-api

An API website built with NPM, Express, Javascript and MongoDb listing famous coders with a form to create a new listing, a trash can to delete a record and a heart to like a record (update).  

One issue that I had with the database is the format of the date.  When I changed the birthdate input field to "date" it changed the way the date showed up in the database.  That's something I need to fix.  I also want to add an image and the ability to click on a coder and get a single page with more info on the coder.  That's a feature I want to add.  Also, the ability to retrieve the coder by id and not by name.
